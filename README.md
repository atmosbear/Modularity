# Modularity
A modular planning app that can do many things within enclosed boxes on the main graph screen. Can be used to take notes, mind map, etc!

Some planned features:
  - click just once to quickly create boxes (modules?) on the main screen
  - ability to have multiple things or just one thing within a single module
  - fade bottom of larger modules; have rounded corners with white
  - allow user to copy modules as templates
  - some module types:
    - generic (done!)
    - text (WIP)
    - image (WIP)
      - with resize capability (WIP)
    - video?
    - drawing?
    - mindmap?
    - graph?
