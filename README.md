# Modularity
*A modular planning app that can do many things within enclosed boxes (dubbed "modules") on the main graph screen. Can be used to take notes, mind map, etc!*

I'm actually very proud of myself with this project because I really like the implementation of the circular dialog. And, I think I'm designing this app particularly well - it was a great chance to use OOP in a place that is natural instead of using it where it might not be so great just for the sake of principle. I tend to favor composition over inheritance, but here inheritance won.

For completed and planned features, see the projects section! :)
