# Modularity
A modular planning app that can do many things within enclosed boxes on the main graph screen. Can be used to take notes, mind map, etc!

I'm actually very proud of myself with this project because I really like the implementation of the circular dialog. And, I think I designed this app particularly well - it was a great chance to use OOP. I tend to favor composition over inheritance, but here inheritance won.

For completed and planned features, see the projects section! :)
